🚀 New SQL Project: India General Election Results Analysis 2024 🇮🇳

I'm excited to share my latest SQL project where I analyzed the 2024 General Election results in India! This project gave me hands-on experience in using SQL for complex data analysis and reinforced my data handling and querying skills.

🔍 Key Highlights:

1. Calculated the total number of seats for the election.
2. Analyzed the state-wise seat distribution.
3. Examined seats won by major alliances: NDA and I.N.D.I.A..
4. Added a new column to classify parties by their alliance (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., OTHER).
5. Identified which party won the most seats across states.
6. Created queries to explore specific metrics such as top candidates, seat breakdowns, and EVM vs. postal votes.

💻 Skills Used:

1. SQL Joins (INNER JOIN, GROUP BY)
2. Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, DISTINCT)
3. Data Manipulation (UPDATE, ALTER)
4. Complex Query Structuring

📊 Project Queries: Here are a few of the queries I wrote for the analysis:

1. Total seats by state
2. Seats won by NDA and I.N.D.I.A. alliance parties
3. Top candidates with the highest EVM votes
4. Breakdown of total votes (EVM and postal) by constituency

This project was a great way to deepen my knowledge of SQL and learn how to handle real-world election datasets. If you're interested in learning more about the project or the queries I used, feel free to reach out!
